        <h2> Project 1: automating library reservation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Collaborated with a team to design and build interactive games focused on motor skill rehabilitation for stroke
                patients, resulting in a 30% improvement in user satisfaction scores from initial testing to final prototype. </li>
            <li> Leveraged p5.js to create engaging visual and tactile experiences, helping users improve coordination and fine motor
                skills through repetitive, targeted exercises. </li>
            <li> Integrated real-time feedback mechanisms to enhance user engagement and track progress. </li>
            <li> Focused on user-centered design to ensure the interface was intuitive and accessible for patients with varying levels of motor function.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Project 2: Stroke patient rehabiliation game</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li> Accomplished automated library room reservation as measured by successful weekly bookings in Hayden Library, by
                using Selenium to navigate the booking site and complete the reservation process. </li>
            <li> Accomplished consistent reservation refresh as measured by automated scheduling every 7 days at 12 am, by
                implementing a scheduled script to re-run the booking process at the specified interval. </li>
            <li> Accomplished error handling and retry functionality as measured by successful bookings after unexpected site changes
                or errors, by adding conditional checks and reattempt mechanisms in Selenium for a stable booking process. </li>
            <li> Accomplished non-intrusive automated access as measured by completing reservations without manual intervention,
                by setting up environment variables and browser options to mimic regular user behavior. </li>
        </ul>
